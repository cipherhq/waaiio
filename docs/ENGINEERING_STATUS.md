## Stage Definitions

See [`docs/ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW.md`](./ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW.md) for full definitions.

**Important:** `IMPLEMENTED` and `LOCALLY_TESTED` do not mean merged or deployed. Only `MERGED` and beyond indicate code is on `main`. Only `PRODUCTION_VERIFIED` indicates a feature is confirmed working in production.

**Important:** `main` may be ahead of production. A commit on `main` is not necessarily deployed. Automatic Vercel Preview deployments on PR branches do not advance a milestone to `DEPLOYED`.

## Stranded Work

### FIN-LEGACY (PRs #18-#21)

PR #21 (`fix/combined-18-19-20`, head `22168545`) contains tested but unmerged financial safety work across 270 changed files:

- Payout kill switch (`ENABLE_PAYOUTS`)
- Payout idempotency keys
- Payout atomic claiming (CAS)
- Square OAuth CSRF protection
- Admin query credential column filtering
- Destination fingerprinting

**Why stranded:**
- 270 files, 48 migrations — too large for safe review
- Migrations 244-248 directly conflict with main's applied migrations
- Migrations 249-291 are stranded/reserved while PR #21 remains open
- Auth patterns use obsolete `profiles.role` (replaced by PR #36's `app_metadata`)

**Next action:** Controlled extraction via FIN-001 and subsequent milestones. Do not merge or rebase PR #21 wholesale.

## Active Next Actions

1. **OPS-001: Merge final closeout PR then close Issue #53** — All 124 actionable migration-history repairs complete (Batches 1-9); 12 not-verifiable and 2 superseded remain intentionally unrepaired
2. **Resolve Meta WABA billing** — required before AUTH-000 production verification
3. **Continue controlled FIN-LEGACY extraction** — payout idempotency, atomic claims, OAuth reconstruction in future milestones

## OPS-001 Current State

- All batches (1-9) verification and migration-history repair complete. PR #81 merged.
- Batch 9 repair complete: 4 versions (242, 243, 245, 246), remote count 224 → 228 (+4), 101-246 tracked count 128 → 132 (+4).
- 124 migration-history repairs complete across Batches 1-9.
- Active repair allowlist: 0 (all actionable repairs complete).
- ALIGNED_TRACKED = 132, VERIFIED_APPLIED_UNTRACKED = 0, PENDING = 0, NOT_VERIFIABLE = 12, SUPERSEDED = 2.
- 12 NOT_VERIFIABLE_SAFELY and 2 SUPERSEDED migrations intentionally remain unrepaired.
- Migration 298 is applied and forensically verified.
- Issue #53 remains open pending merge and final closure.

## Updating This Ledger

Every milestone PR must update `docs/engineering-status.json` when:
- A milestone advances to a new stage
- Evidence is recorded (merge SHA, deployment, verification)
- A blocker is added or resolved
- A milestone is closed

### Post-Merge Updates

A PR cannot mark itself `MERGED` before it merges. After a PR merges:
1. Update the ledger in the next commit or PR to record `MERGED` stage and merge SHA
2. After production deployment, update again with `DEPLOYED` and deployed SHA
3. After production verification, update with `PRODUCTION_VERIFIED` and evidence
