### Bot Flows
- **Booking RPC enum casts** (migration 141) — `book_slot_atomic` now casts text to `flow_type`, `booking_channel`, `deposit_status`, `reservation_status` enums. Affects: ALL bookings across all businesses.
- **Booking RPC FOR UPDATE fix** (migration 140) — split `SELECT COUNT(*) FOR UPDATE` into `PERFORM FOR UPDATE` + `SELECT COUNT(*)`. Affects: ALL bookings.
- **Proactive payment confirmation** — webhook handler now sends WhatsApp confirmation after successful payment, even if customer never taps "I've Paid". File: `lib/payments/webhook-handler.ts`
- **Special requests — business-driven** — removed hardcoded category defaults (salon="Sensitive scalp", etc.). Now fully driven by `business.metadata.special_request_options`. File: `lib/bot/flows/scheduling.flow.ts`
- **Loyalty/referral removed from category defaults** — no longer auto-enabled for new businesses. Opt-in only from dashboard. File: `lib/capabilities/types.ts`
- **Empty state routing** — loyalty (no points), invoices (no invoices), subscriptions (no subs) now route back to My Account menu instead of dead-ending. Files: `loyalty.flow.ts`, `invoice.flow.ts`, `recurring-manage.flow.ts`
- **My Account button** — added to ticket detail, reservation detail, order detail views. File: `lib/bot/bot.service.ts`
- **Promo code product targeting** — dashboard UI for All Products vs Specific Products. Bot only shows promo when applicable. Files: `ordering.flow.ts`, `scheduling.flow.ts`, `app/dashboard/promo-codes/page.tsx`
- **Promo verified message** — bot confirms "Promo code verified! Discount applied at checkout." Files: `scheduling.flow.ts`, `ordering.flow.ts`
- **Referral step cleanup** — verified both flows already had skipIf gating by capability. No change needed.
- **Cross-country routing fix** — shared numbers only auto-route returning customers to businesses in same country. File: `lib/bot/bot.service.ts`
- **Returning customer skip name** — ordering flow now skips collect_name for returning users (was missing skipIf). File: `ordering.flow.ts`

### Reservation
- **Booked dates filtered** — check-in and check-out pickers now filter existing reservations, not just blocked dates. File: `reservation.flow.ts`
- **Availability before T&C** — check overlapping reservations before showing terms, not after. File: `reservation.flow.ts`

### Security
- **CSRF www fix** — middleware now allows both www and non-www variants of app URL. File: `middleware.ts`
- **WhatsApp support number** — changed to +1 571-274-6425. File: `app/(marketing)/layout.tsx`

### Infrastructure
- **Canadian shared channel registered** — +1 639-739-1803, phone_number_id: 1059938863874835
- **Norma country code** — changed back to NG (was incorrectly set to US, causing Stripe amount overflow)

### Campaign
- **Campaign stats fixed** — all stuck campaign_donations updated to success, raised_amount recalculated from actual donations. Direct DB fix.
